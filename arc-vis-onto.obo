[Term]
id: dpvis:Scatterplot
name: Scatterplot
def: Plot that shows 2D points that may be colored individually
! is_a: BubbleChart


[Term]
id: dpvis:Heatmap
name: Heatmap
def: Matrix visualization to compare two sequences by coloring the fields e.g. w.r.t. some similarity
! is_a: TwoDimVis

[Term]
id: dpvis:DotPlot
name: Dot Plot
def: Matrix visualization to compare two (bio) sequences by drawing black dots in fields that match
! is_a: Heatmap


[Term]
id: dpvis:VertBarChart
name: Vertical Bar Chart
def: Chart that has a vertical bar for every (named) scalar variable

[Term]
id: dpvis:HoriBarChart
name: Horizontal Bar Chart
def: Chart that has a horizontal bar for every (named) scalar variable

[Term]
id: dpvis:VarWiBarChart
name: Variable-width Bar Chart
def: Like a [VertBarChart] but takes 2D variables and the width of a bar represents the value in the second dimension

[Term]
id: dpvis:StackedBarChart
name: Stacked Bar Chart
def: Like a [VertBarChart] but the scalar variables depend on an additional dimension (typically a set of categories)

[Term]
id: dpvis:Stacked100BarChart
name: Stacked 100% Bar Chart
def: Like a [StackedBarChart] but every bar has the same height s.t. the proportions of the categories can easily be compared across the bars


[Term]
id: dpvis:LineChart
name: Line Chart
def: Chart that shows a line for one or more scalar variables that are defined on a continuous 1D domain

[Term]
id: dpvis:StackedAreaChart
name: Stacked Area Chart
def: Similar to a [LineChart] but there are always at least two lines and their height is given by stacking and the area under the lines is filled accordingly

[Term]
id: dpvis:Stacked100AreaChart
name: Stacked 100% Area Chart
def: Like a [StackedAreaChart] but the accumalated height at each sample is normalized to 100%

[Term]
id: dpvis:CircularAreaChart
name: Circular Area Chart
def: Similar to a [LineChart] but the area under the line is filled and the domain is mapped to 360° (and the chart drawn accordingly) with axes for the codomain repeated e.g. every 45°


[Term]
id: dpvis:BarHistogram
name: Bar Histogram
def: Show a univariate distribution by bars whose position and width corresponds to bins of the sample space and whose height corresponds to the data count there

[Term]
id: dpvis:LineHistogram
name: Line Histogram
def: Show a univariate distribution by a continuous line whose height is determined by the probability


[Term]
id: dpvis:PieChart
name: Pie Chart
def: A circle whose sections (or slices) are represent a relative size


[Term]
id: dpvis:Treemap
name: Treemap
def: Visualization of a tree data structure whose nodes are represented by nested rectangles whose area reflects some variable.


[Term]
id: dpvis:WaterfallChart
name: Waterfall Chart
def: Similar to a [VertBarChart] where the x-axis represents time or categories and the bars start at the top or bottom of its predecessor, growing up or down depending on the sign of the depicted variable
comment: Aka. flying bricks chart or Mario chart
